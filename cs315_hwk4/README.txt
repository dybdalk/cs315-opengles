/**********************************************************************
* What is your name?
***********************************************************************/

Kyle Fiscus Dybdal


/**********************************************************************
* Describe any inspiration for your robot and its dance!
***********************************************************************/

I attempted to make it look like a running person!



/**********************************************************************
* Is there anything I need to know about building and running your app?
***********************************************************************/

My emulator always crashed while running it (old laptop), so I have no idea
whether or not it'll run on yours. It runs perfectly on my HTC One, though



/**********************************************************************
* Did you add any extensions to the assignment that I should be aware 
* of?
***********************************************************************/

no



/**********************************************************************
* Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete assignment?
***********************************************************************/

10-12


/**********************************************************************
 * Describe any serious problems you encountered in this assignment.
 * What was hard, or what should we warn students about in the future?
 * How can I make this assignment better?
 **********************************************************************/

I couldn't get the animation controls to work. It crashed everytime i tried to load the
GLBasicView from xml. I got "error opening trace file: no such file or directory"
So that's unfortunate.

Very satisfying project! i definitely felt over my head at first, but once i got a solid understanding of the
concept, it became less overwhelming.
